# Road Sign Classifier

*Self Learning Project*

## Project Description
In the era of smart vehicles, why not make your own vehicle smart by designing your own model and deploying it. With the help of a dash-cam, you too can make your car-a smart car. In this project, I have designed a customized CNN architecture to detect different classes of Road signs. I have currently deployed this model on a famous python framework called Tkinter, and have designed a GUI, which will classify the traffic sign.
Many accident occur due to disregard towards road traffic and warning signals, which can be resolved with the help of amazing capabilities of Machine Learning. This project has many further implementations as I have mentioned, and for now I have designed a model with gives me ~ 95% testing accuracy. This project helped me get into the world of Machine Learning and understand it better by this practical implementation.

## Scope
Applications of data science in automobile industry, is proving to be very beneficial to both the customers as well as the engineering and workers behind these vehicles. Giving your vehicle the ability to think and learn, makes me realize someday, `Lightning McQueen` might become real. Using this model, any camera, can detect and classify all road signs and help the user, or the car make decisions accordingly. In this project I have used CNN, to detect and classify 30+ different traffic signs which we see on the roads very frequently. This will also help prevent accidents and following rules would also be a by-product of such a system

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to make a step to words smart autmobiles

## Tools Used
1. Python - Used as programming language as it very powerful and has many libraries for data science making it one of the most convinient languages for data scientists.

2. Tensorflow - A google developed open source software library, used for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

3. Sci-kit - Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms.

4. OpenCV - OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.

## Future Scope
Possible future work would include designing smart vehicles that can make decision based on traffic conditions and road signs without human interference.
