<h2>Traffic Sign Classification</h2>

In this project I have trained a deep learning model to classify diffferent types of Traffic Signs.

The model has achieved the accuracy of 99%. I have used a customized Convulational Neural Network as per my use/benefit. Along with using sequential CNN, I have optmized the model using the ADAM optmizer with some hypterparameter tuning and also used the learning rate optmizer with custom hyerparameters which helped in increasing the accuracy of the model.

I have then deployed this model on python's GUI, tkinter to predict the output of some real life images.

Further application of this would be by deploying this model on openCV and it could be used in Smart Vehicles etc.
